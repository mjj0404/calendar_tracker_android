# Calendar Tracker

Main use of this application is to keep track of an event that is in different calendar.<br />
Below is an example of inconsistant date difference among popular calendars where eastern lunar calendar is commonly known as Chinese Lunar Calendar
| Eastern Lunar | Gegorian | Hijri |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
|2020.01.01|2020.01.25|1441.05.06(Jumada)|
|2021.01.01|2021.02.12|1442.05.17(Jumada)|
|2022.01.01|2022.02.01|1443.05.28(Jumada)|

Each Calendar date system have different way of adding leap year or month, thus make it very hard to track without an effort.
